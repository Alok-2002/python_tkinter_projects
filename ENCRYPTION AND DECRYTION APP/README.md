# Encryption and Decryption Software with Python and tkinter GUI

The Encryption and Decryption software is a GUI application created with Python and tkinter. It uses base64 encoding and decoding to encrypt and decrypt user input. The software allows you to enter a message and a key, and then encrypt or decrypt the message using the key.

## Features

- Encrypt a message using a key
- Decrypt an encrypted message using the same key
- Base64 encoding and decoding
- User-friendly GUI interface

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the `encryption and decryption app.py` file to launch the application.

## Usage

Upon launching the application, you will be presented with a GUI window that allows you to enter a message and a key.

### Encryption

To encrypt a message, enter the message you wish to encrypt in the "Message" field and a key in the "Key" field. Then, click the "Encrypt" button. The encrypted message will be displayed in the "Encrypted Message" field.

### Decryption

To decrypt an encrypted message, enter the encrypted message you wish to decrypt in the "Encrypted Message" field and the key used to encrypt the message in the "Key" field. Then, click the "Decrypt" button. The decrypted message will be displayed in the "Decrypted Message" field.

### Encoding and Decoding

The software uses base64 encoding and decoding to encrypt and decrypt messages. You do not need to encode or decode the message or key yourself before using the software. The software will handle this automatically.
